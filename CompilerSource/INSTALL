The build makefile will, by default, compile a file that is named compileEGMf in the ENIGMA directory.  However, this should be named either compileEGMf.dll or libcompileEGMf.so.  The makefile can do this:
make or make build - Compiles compileEGMf
make build-standalone - Compiles compileEGMf with extra debugging support
make win - Runs the build target and then renames to compileEGMf.dll
make linux or unix - Compiles the build target and then renames to libcompileEGMf.so
make win-standalone - Compiles the build-standalone target and then renames to compileEGMf.dll
make linux-standalone or unix-standalone - Compiles the build-standalone target and then renames to libcompileEGMf.so
