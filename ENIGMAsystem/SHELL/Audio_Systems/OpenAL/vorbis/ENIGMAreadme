This folder contains the essentials of libvorbis-1.3.1.

The contents were obtained by downloading the source distribution
of the Vorbis codec and removing any unnecessary components and a
pair of source files. The removed sources included an erroneous C
source marked as a historical record, and the file that serves to
encode vorbis sounds. It turns out that said encoder was the only
file that would not compile without running the 15000 line config
script.
