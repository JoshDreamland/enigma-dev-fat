/*\\\ This file contains prototypes for functions that must be defined by the graphics
|*||| library modules. Each of these is used by other systems throughout the engine.
\*/// Accidental failure to implement them could cause error.

void graphicssystem_initialize(); // Called at game load to allow the system to set up.
// This function can be implemented as an empty call if it is not needed.

const char* draw_get_graphics_error(); // Return a const char* error string, if any
// error has occurred, or an empty string otherwise.
